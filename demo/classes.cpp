/*
A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from the class.

Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".
A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

An object is a grouping of data (variables) and operations that can be performed on that data (functions).
An object has operations that a user can apply. The object's internal data, and possibly other operations, 
are hidden from the user.

Inside class definition
Outside class definition

/*
A programmer defining a class first declares member functions after the word "public:"
in the class definition. A function declaration provides the function's name, return type, 
and parameter types, but not the function's statements.

A function definition provides a class name, return type, parameter names and types, 
and the function's statements. A member function definition has the class name and 
two colons (::), known as the scope resolution operator, preceding the function's name. 
A member function definition can access private data members.

Just like functions, constructors can also be defined outside the class. First, declare the constructor inside the class,

C++ has a special class member function, a constructor, called automatically when 
a variable of that class type is declared, and which can initialize data members.
A constructor callable without arguments is a default constructor.
A constructor has the same name as the class. A constructor function has no return type, not even void

In C++, there are three access specifiers:

public - members are accessible from outside the class
private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.

By default, all members of a class are private if you don't specify an access specifier:

  /*
  const keyword
  A function declared with the const keyword is a constant function. Constant functions 
  are popular due to their ability to prevent accidental changes to the objectâ€™s value.
  Declaring a member function with the const keyword specifies that the function is a "read-only" 
  function that doesn't modify the object for which it's called. A constant member function can't modify 
  any non-static data members or call any member functions that aren't constant

  A mutator function may modify ("mutate") a class' data members.
  An accessor function accesses data members but does not modify a class' data members.
 
  The keyword const after a member function's name and parameters causes 
  a compiler error if the function modifies a data member. If a const member function 
  calls another member function, that function must also be const.

  Accessor functions usually are defined as const to make clear that data members 
  won't be changed.

 Just the class definition appears in the .h. All the function definitions appear 
 in a .cpp file.

 ClassName.h contains the class definition, including data members and member function declarations.
 ClassName.cpp contains member function definitions.
